# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a 1960s era video game played on an m-by-n grid of cells. The goal is to deduce which cells contain hidden mines using clues about the number of mines in neighboring cells. Write a program Minesweeper.java that takes three integer command-line arguments m, n, and k and prints an m-by-n grid of cells with k mines, using asterisks for mines and integers for the neighboring mine counts (with two space characters between each cell). To do so,

    Generate an m-by-n grid of cells, with exactly k of the mn cells containing mines, uniformly at random.

    For each cell not containing a mine, count the number of neighboring mines (above, below, left, right, or diagonal).
